# RandomPromptGenerator
A simple program to randomly shuffle tags for stable diffusion prompts

Simply insert your prompt in the form of a list of tags seperated by commas and click add to add to the used list, you can select tags and move them to the prefix list where they will always come first in the generated prompt, or move them to the unused list to save for later. Select the emphasis to randomize from the drop down and click generate to create a prompt. The UI is self explanatory.

As a quick example if I add

cat, orange, sunshine

and I change my emphasis to 3, my output will be randomized to:

(orange), (cat), (((sunshine)))

Try the randomized outputs in Stable Diffusion to see how the randomized shuffling changes your output!
